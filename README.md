# Welcome to QForest!

This repository contains resources to get you started in the field of quantum computing.
  
### Getting started :rocket:
- _New to quantum computing?_  
If you are, then that's amazing! You're about to be introduced to a whole new world of possibilities: take a [Dive Into The Quantum Realm](https://medium.com/qvillage/diving-into-the-quantum-realm-124c26f293cb) with us!  
  
- _For an in-depth introduction to the math under the hood, you can check these out:_
  - [qkitchen](https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/basics-of-quantum-computing/-/tree/master/math): Explanations along with a few fun exercises.  
  - [Week 0: A crash course on quantum information](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CaltechDelftX+QuCryptox+3T2018/course/): A few really good videos on the basics of quantum information and the math behind it. 
  - [IBM Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/linear_algebra.html): Linear algebra for quantum computation.  
  - [Quantum Algorithms via Linear Algebra](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149911380.pdf): Feel free to refer to topics in chapters 1-6 for queries related to the math behind quantum computing.
  - [Teach Me Quantum](https://github.com/msramalho/Teach-Me-Quantum): An open-source university-level course on Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Science that incorporates IBM Q Experience and Qiskit.
